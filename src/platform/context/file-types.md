title: "File types"
---

An artifact is a navigable piece of prototype work backed by a file, such as a view, document, diagram, or canvas. Folders organize artifacts; helpers, metadata, and other assets remain supporting files.

A file type is the module capability declared by `type.ts` that recognizes and renders those files. Enabled types determine how artifacts are discovered, created, opened, and embedded.

## Scopes

| Module | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Views | Required prototype `.tsx` and `.jsx` views. |
| Diagrams | Optional prototype `.mermaid` and `.mmd` diagrams. |
| Documents | Optional prototype `.md` pages. |
| Systems | Required system context `.md` pages. |
| Canvases | Optional prototype `.excalidraw` scenes. |
| Text files | Required fallback for other system context text files. |

Extension ownership is unique within each scope. Documents and system context can both claim `.md` because their scopes differ.

Other prototype files remain plain files. Underscore helpers are excluded from normal artifact discovery.

## Files and fields

`src/platform/core/fileTypes.ts` defines `FileTypeSpec`, `defineFileType`, and artifact slug handling. A team module imports them from `#studio/files`, and the browser side of a file type (the manifest, file reading, `createLoader`, `FileTypeModule`) from `#studio/data` ([public API](modules.md#public-api)).

The `identity` adapter for prototype file types reads and writes permanent prototype-artifact metadata. Views, Documents, Diagrams, and Canvases provide it. System content keeps its existing path identification. Creation allocates IDs, saves preserve them, and public prototype routes use them. New directly authored files require `pnpm studio identify <prototype-folder> --yes`; builds never allocate them. See [Resource identity](resource-identity.md).

| File | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `module.ts` | Standard module identity and optional status. |
| `type.ts` | Extensions, label, language, capabilities, implementations, validation, and scope flags. |
| `open.tsx` | Icon, loader, page, optional live `Embed`, and module-owned actions. |
| `loader.ts` | Production file globs and its own HMR acceptance. |
| `references.ts` | Optional Node-only source adapters for moves and copied permanent links. |

`type.ts` imports `#studio/files` and Node-safe helpers within its own module. Checks validate the complete executable dependency graph in Node. A local adapter cannot relay browser code or private platform imports into a team declaration. View, Diagrams, and Canvas own their identity grammars; the platform supplies generic ID, Markdown, and JSON primitives.

`inPrototype`, `inSystemContent`, and `fallback` are required booleans. `inPrototype: true` permits prototype artifacts; `inSystemContent: true` permits system knowledge files. Omission fails validation. A `fallback` type opens other system context text files without claiming extensions.

## Prototype and system dependencies

From platform 0.1.0, every type explicitly declares `systemUsage: 'assigned'` or `'independent'`. Views consume the prototype's assigned runtime toolkit. Documents, Diagrams, Canvas scenes, and knowledge readers render independently. Missing declarations fail validation; existing third-party types must add this field before they can load. Modules using this field or the new reference and lifecycle APIs declare `requires: '0.1.0'`.

The prototype owns identity, source authority, organization, archive status and publication eligibility. Its `systemId` remains the single product-system assignment. Independent rendering does not grant access to another system or discard relevant product context.

`artifactSystemAvailability` is available through `#studio/files`. The shared availability resolver accepts the prototype's validated `systemMissing` state. Pages and document/canvas previews refuse system-consuming renderers with an explanatory reason. Source remains readable and repairable. Nested previews resolve their own dependency state; a missing view does not block a document or canvas scene.

Independent artifacts remain locally readable after system deletion. Affected prototypes remain excluded from publication until rebuilt. Prototype archiving still excludes the whole container.

## Source reference adapters

A module may export an adapter list from `references.ts`, importing Node-only helpers and types through `#studio/references`. Each adapter declares unique `extensions`, a `move` transformation and a `copy` transformation. Extensions cover supporting files and underscore helpers too; they do not register additional artifacts.

The adapter understands syntax and returns source text. Platform callbacks resolve relative paths, imports, navigation targets and exact permanent-link mappings. Preserve queries, fragments, external origins and unrecognized dynamic expressions. The platform prepares edits, checks file versions and containment, and owns authorized writes and rollback. Invalid or oversized output aborts the operation. Adapters must not write files themselves.

Installed adapters remain available for source maintenance when their runtime module is disabled, like retained identity adapters. Removal removes the grammar but preserves authored content; unknown source is not guessed or rewritten. Duplicate extension ownership is a check error.

Views owns code and CSS source adapters. Text files owns the shared Markdown grammar, including system knowledge and retained Documents source. Canvas owns Excalidraw links and scene update rules. Ordinary Markdown moves and copied permanent links preserve prose and fenced examples. Prototype renaming preserves permanent IDs and browser links.

## Artifact capabilities

Every file type declares a required `capabilities` object in `type.ts`. Node commands and browser readers consume the same declaration. It describes support, not current permission or preview readiness.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `source` | Local source viewing and editing are supported. A supported `language` is required. |
| `create` | The type offers new-file creation. It must match the presence of a `template` function. |
| `fidelity` | Prototype fidelity switching is supported. It must match the `fidelity` implementation. |
| `embeds` | Allowed live-preview host IDs, or `[]`. Built-in hosts are `document` and `canvas`; modules declare namespaced hosts. |
| `actions` | Namespaced module-owned action IDs, or `[]`. Implementations live in `open.tsx`. |

Declare every field, including false and empty values. Unknown fields, duplicate surfaces, unsupported surfaces, and invalid action IDs fail validation. File types always supply a page and loader; there is no separate optional page capability.

The enabled browser registry validates that declared embed surfaces have an `Embed` and that declared actions match implementations. An undeclared implementation is an error, not permission to expose behavior.

`artifactAvailability(spec, context)` separates `supported` from `available`. Unavailable results include a reason. The caller explicitly supplies local/published mode, current edit authority, artifact presence, renderer availability, and content scope. Missing or disabled types have no active support.

Source viewing remains available without edit permission. It does not depend on a working page renderer, so broken code remains repairable. Source edits and fidelity changes require current edit authority and local execution. Creation does not require an existing artifact. Pages and embeds require an artifact and renderer in the declared content scope. Embed resolution checks that scope as well as the declared surface. The resolver describes UI availability; server write checks remain authoritative.

### Module-owned actions

A type can add an action without changing the shared file menu. Declare its ID in `capabilities.actions`, then provide the implementation in `open.tsx.actions`. IDs use `<file-type-id>.<action-name>`.

Each implementation supplies `id`, `label`, `run`, and explicit `localOnly` and `mutates` booleans. An optional `icon` uses the shared icon type. An optional `unavailable(context)` returns a reason or `null`; it must be a read-only availability check. Context contains the prototype, artifact, and availability environment.

The shared menu shows declared actions and explains unavailable ones. `runArtifactAction` requires a resolver that reads current declarations, artifact identity, and authority after the menu closes. A removed artifact, changed type, unmounted reader, or revoked permission cannot reuse a captured menu context. Studio applies its own refusals before calling module availability checks. Callback failures or invalid results keep the action unavailable with a diagnostic reason. Mutating actions require local execution and edit authority regardless of `localOnly`. Handlers must use authorized server operations for writes; these flags are not authentication. Read-only actions with `localOnly: false` can appear in published artifact menus. Existing types declare no additional actions.

For example, a file type can declare `actions: ['view.inspect']` and implement a nonmutating `view.inspect` action that opens its inspection surface. This is an extension example, not an implemented inspector. Keep dependencies within module boundaries. A separate optional inspection module would need its own deliberate integration contract; do not import its private implementation into another module.

### Updating existing file types

Replace `preview` in `type.ts` and `embedSurfaces` in `open.tsx` with `capabilities.embeds`. Copy the actual browser surfaces; do not translate `preview: false` to an empty array blindly. Canvas previously used false for canvas sizing while still providing document previews.

Add explicit `source`, `create`, `fidelity`, and `actions` declarations. Keep syntax, template, and fidelity functions as implementation details. Do not add capabilities to prototype files or a second artifact registry. Permanent identity and module enablement retain their existing contracts.

Future inspection and exports can extend these boundaries. No inspector, new export format, or agent runtime is implied by the declaration. Renderers use the existing [shared lifecycle contract](source.md#artifact-revision-and-preview-lifecycle).

## Rendering and source

Supported editor languages are `tsx`, `markdown`, `json`, `mermaid`, and `text`. The template supplies new-file content. The check reports invalid content.

The app record is `Artifact`, and a loaded `Prototype` holds an `artifacts` collection. Manifest lookup and navigation use `findArtifact`, `firstArtifact`, `artifactLink`, and `artifactSlug`. Shared readers such as the system context reuse the same record and file-type machinery while keeping their own user-facing document terms.

An `Embed` in `open.tsx` supplies a read-only preview for documents and canvases. Core resolves references and uses this contract without importing individual modules. The required `capabilities.embeds` array in `type.ts` explicitly permits declared host IDs, or neither (`[]`). Omission never enables a surface. Types without a preview on that surface appear as cards. Canvas restricts its preview to documents, keeping canvas nesting bounded.

A module can provide a lightweight `EmbedPending` in `open.tsx` for document loading. The shared reader uses it during reference resolution and lazy renderer loading. It passes the same `loadingStartedAt` timestamp to the pending surface and `Embed`, so delayed feedback can continue across the handoff. Modules without this surface retain generic loading feedback. The pending component must not import its heavy renderer.

Prototype documents use `![Description](./relative/file.ext)` on its own line. The shared Markdown reader resolves the exact file within the same prototype, renders the registered preview or card, and provides an Open link. Inline references stay links. Missing or disabled types show an unavailable message. Ordinary image formats retain Markdown image behavior.

Preview surfaces use the shared `EmbedFrame`: rounded corners and a full-width gray header link that darkens and reveals Open on hover or keyboard focus. Header text is never underlined. Preview contents are inert; interaction happens after opening the file.

A loader uses `import.meta.glob(['/__studio_globs__/*'])`. Vite replaces the placeholder with extensions and content roots, excluding archived prototypes in production.

## Page preparation

Route readers call `prepareFile` to prepare content and the registered `Page` together. Deferred page components expose `preload` through TanStack `lazyRouteComponent`. A raw React lazy component does not provide this preparation contract. The module loader returns page props and handles its file access. Rendered canvases and diagrams may then show their own loading status while initializing their scene or SVG. See [Navigation handoff](source.md#navigation-handoff).

## Lifecycle

Follow the [module contract](modules.md) for installation, disabling, removal, and dependency boundaries.

Disabling a prototype file type preserves its files as plain files. Normal navigation hides them unless Show all files is selected.

The first available artifact in navigation order opens by default. Disabling a file type removes its artifacts from that order.

Required types cannot be disabled or removed with studio commands. Required types may be imported by the platform and other modules.

Restart the dev server after capability changes. Ordinary content edits are reflected during development.

## Add a type

1. Create a module declaration with the appropriate optional status and system context routing.
2. Add `type.ts` and `open.tsx`. Use Documents as a small reference implementation.
3. Add `loader.ts` if published content needs bundled file loading.
4. Use the artifact registry to resolve other artifacts rather than importing optional file types.
5. Run module checks and a build. Verify disabling and removal for optional types.

The mixed-artifact conformance fixture lives in `node/lib/fixtures/artifacts.js`. Its integration test installs a team-owned format in a disposable studio using only public APIs. It verifies identity, mixed discovery, reference moves and copying, disabled source maintenance, missing-system availability, production base paths and retained content after removal. Browser interaction checks complement this source/build suite.

## Artifact resolution and host declarations

`#studio/data` provides `inspectArtifact(request, manifest)` for synchronous metadata decisions and `resolveArtifact(request, { manifest, signal })` for lazy inventory completion. Both validate the current origin and use one reference/scope/availability policy. Inspection does not import format renderers. Permanent addresses survive source moves; source-relative references stay within their origin prototype and exclude helper files. Published inventories omit disabled content, so an absent ID is unavailable without asserting why.

The shared Markdown reader owns the `document` host independently of the optional Document file type. Canvas declares its `canvas` host in `module.ts`. Other hosts declare `hosts: [{ id: "owner/surface", scopes: ["prototype"], references: "same-prototype" }]`. Missing or disabled hosts make presentation unavailable; retained capability references remain valid. Malformed, foreign-owned, and duplicate declarations fail validation. Cross-prototype reference policies require a separate architecture decision.

`#studio/ui` exports `ArtifactHost`. It owns shared frames, cards, lazy renderer preparation, pending feedback, and error containment. Callers supply dimensions, interaction mode, presentation preference, admission, and visibility. Hidden previews remain mounted; a card preference cannot force an unavailable preview. The shared Markdown reader supplies current origin metadata through its private context and retains responsive measurement. Format modules continue to own source and displayed-output lifecycle evidence.

In artifact navigation menus, prioritize in-Studio design work: source editing, fidelity, and contributed artifact actions. Follow with one group containing Rename, external editor/Finder, and copy utilities, and keep Delete last and separate. Folder creation remains first for folders. The prototype header has its own visibility-first grouping.
