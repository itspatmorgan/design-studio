# Create Diagram

This skill applies to standalone prototype diagrams when Diagrams is enabled. Read the [module README](../../README.md) for file and rendering behavior.

- Use a `.mermaid` file by default. Existing `.mmd` files work too.
- Write plain Mermaid source without Markdown fences. One file holds one diagram.
- Choose the diagram type for the relationship and the intended audience. Use standard Mermaid syntax; the platform does not restrict authors to a subset of diagram types.
- Include `accTitle` and `accDescr` where the diagram type supports them.
- Keep prototype diagrams inside that prototype, outside underscore helpers. No registration is needed.
- Use Mermaid fences inside documents when a diagram belongs with an explanation. Use a standalone file when it needs its own navigation entry or canvas preview.
- Link to standalone diagrams using relative paths with their file extensions. In a prototype document, use `![Description](./flow.mermaid)` on its own line for a live embed with an Open diagram link. Keep the referenced file in the same prototype.
- Reuse platform theme defaults. Apply explicit diagram colors only when they carry meaning, and check both light and dark modes.
- To transfer a diagram to Excalidraw, use its existing Mermaid import. The imported canvas is a separate artifact; later source edits do not synchronize it.
- Apply the [contributor scope](../../../../context/contributor-scope.md) before editing prototype files.

Write the source directly. The local app discovers new files and reflects edits. Invalid syntax is shown as a render error. Inspect and repair it through the file menu’s Edit source action.

For new directly authored artifacts, preview and apply [identity assignment](../../../../context/resource-identity.md#direct-authoring-and-verification). Preserve existing identity metadata when editing.

## Verify

Inspect the rendered artifact, its links, and any embeds. Repair reported rendering errors and follow platform working context for required checks. Report the artifact link and unresolved content.
