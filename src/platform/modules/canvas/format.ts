// The canvas file: an Excalidraw scene, kept small and stable so canvases diff cleanly in git and
// an agent can read and edit them.
//
// - Deleted elements are never stored (undoing a delete is in-memory history).
// - Images are never stored and `files` is always empty: an image's bytes would be written into
//   this file. A canvas shows the view itself instead.
// - Fields at Excalidraw's default are dropped; `restoreElements` fills them back in on load.
//   `version`, `versionNonce` and `index` are kept: merging changes needs them.
// - Numbers are rounded, keys are sorted, and volatile fields (`updated`) are dropped.
// - A link to an item is stored as its address in the app ("/samples/hello-world/lofi/main"),
//   so a canvas works on any host and under any base path.
