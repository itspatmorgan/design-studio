# Studio system

Studio supplies Design Studio's application components, theme, and writing conventions. Prototype runtime code cannot import this application toolkit.

Read `AGENTS.md` and [writing context](context/writing.md) for Studio interface work. Components and their API pages live in `components/`; theme implementation lives in `styles/`.

Platform operating context and skills belong to the [platform](../../README.md). Design-system authoring procedures belong to the [Systems module](../../modules/systems/README.md). Studio currently has no specialized system skills.

`components.json` records this system’s upstream shadcn choices. It does not capture all authored theme or component adaptations. System folders are not independent CLI projects; follow the [Systems configuration contract](../../modules/systems/README.md#structure) for isolated generation.

## Platform brand assets

The navigation uses the unboxed mark in [Logo.tsx](../../app/shell/Logo.tsx). External placements use the square tiles below. Both tile variants share a 64-unit square, a 14-unit corner radius, and a mark occupying about 56% of the width. The mark is centered vertically and shifted 1 unit right of geometric center to balance its heavier left side. Preserve the complete square and optical offset when resizing; do not crop to the mark.

| Placement | Asset | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light surface | `public/brand/design-studio-light.svg` and `.png` | SVG and 512 × 512 PNG |
| Dark surface | `public/brand/design-studio-dark.svg` and `.png` | SVG and 512 × 512 PNG |
| Browser tab | `public/favicon.svg` | Adapts its tile and mark to the browser color scheme |
| Browser fallback | `public/favicon.ico` | 16, 32, and 48 px |
| Apple touch icon | `public/apple-touch-icon.png` | 180 × 180 |
| Open Graph, Twitter, and light README | `public/images/design-studio-social.png` | 1200 × 630 |
| Dark sharing placement and dark README | `public/images/design-studio-social-dark.png` | 1200 × 630 |
| GitHub repository social preview | `public/images/design-studio-github.png` | 1280 × 640 |
| Product screenshots | `public/images/design-studio-product-light.jpg` and `design-studio-product-dark.jpg` | 1280 × 720 |
| README header image | `public/images/design-studio-readme-share.jpg` | 1200 × 630 |

The editable sharing artwork is [social-card.html](assets/brand/social-card.html). Open it from the repository with dependencies installed. It uses the local Geist font and the public logo tiles. Render at 1200 × 630, wait for fonts and images, and export the light and dark PNGs using the respective browser color schemes. Export the light render as a compressed JPEG when a smaller alternative is needed. The README selects the matching social card and product screenshot with `<picture>`, falling back to light. The default external sharing image stays light because link previews do not select artwork by the viewer's theme.

For GitHub, fit the light social card into 1280 × 640 without cropping or stretching, using its background color for the remaining horizontal margin. Upload it through the repository's **Settings → General → Social preview**; changing the README does not update that setting.

Product screenshots show the supplied Feedback Inbox sample with Studio navigation visible. Recapture the working inbox in both themes after relevant interface changes. Remove hover tooltips and open menus, wait for fonts and preview content, and keep the real interface intact. These screenshots are documentation and marketing assets, not per-prototype link previews.

When changing the mark, update the navigation paths and public tile SVGs together, then regenerate the raster icons and sharing images. See [Publishing](../../context/publishing.md#social-link-previews) for the metadata and public URL setup.
